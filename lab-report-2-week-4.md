Problem: updated index twice 
Symptom: unexpected output


-  in fact, my group did not strictly make three changes to the code 

failure - inducing input : an input or a test-case which causes your code to fail (i.e. exception (compile time, runtime) or cause nonsensical output) 
symptom : is a problem/ an outcome different from the expected 
Symptoms can be the same but have different causes : you can get similar problems or output, but it is caused by a different bug.
